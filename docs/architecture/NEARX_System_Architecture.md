# NEARX System Architecture Blueprint

## 1. Overview
- **Architecture Style**: Microservices with event-driven components, deployed on AWS/GCP with Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **Core Domains**: Customer Experience, Merchant/Provider Operations, Delivery Logistics, Matching & Personalization, Payments & Finance, Support & Compliance.
- **Foundational Tenets**: Proximity-first logic, high availability (99.9%), security & compliance, scalability from 1k to 1M+ users, sustainability insights.

## 2. High-Level Component Map
1. **API Gateway & BFF Layer**
   - GraphQL/REST gateway (Kong/Apigee) routing to microservices.
   - Platform-specific Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) services for Mobile (React Native) and Web (Next.js Admin).
2. **Identity & Access Service**
   - AuthN/Z (OTP, 2FA), OAuth integration, role-based access control.
   - Token issuance (JWT) with short-lived sessions; refresh tokens stored securely.
3. **User & Profile Service**
   - Manages user accounts, preferences (eco, price sensitivity, favorites), addresses.
4. **Catalog & Inventory Service**
   - Product catalogs, service listings, inventory levels, allergen metadata.
   - Supports try-before-buy flags and AR metadata.
5. **Orders & Booking Service**
   - Handles carts, bookings, deposits, status transitions, refunds.
   - Supports multi-merchant carts, split orders, emergency service flags.
6. **Matching Engine Service**
   - Real-time scoring using distance, availability, rating, price, load, personalization.
   - Integrates with ML service for recommendations.
7. **Delivery Orchestration Service**
   - Assigns delivery partners, manages routing, rerouting, SOS handling, insurance hooks.
8. **Service Scheduling Service**
   - Provider calendars, availability slots, try-before-buy scheduling.
9. **Payment Orchestration Service**
   - Integrations: Stripe, Khalti, eSewa, PhonePe, NEARX wallet.
   - Payment intents, pre-authorizations, split settlements, refunds.
10. **Review & Reputation Service**
    - Ratings, media uploads, moderation queue, sentiment scoring.
11. **Support & Dispute Service**
    - In-app chat, ticketing, escalation workflows, knowledge base.
12. **Notification & Messaging Service**
    - Push (FCM/APNs), SMS, email; template-driven; message queue triggers.
13. **Analytics & Insights Platform**
    - Event ingestion (Mixpanel/GA), aggregated dashboards, sustainability metrics.
14. **Admin Portal Service**
    - Role-based dashboards, approval workflows, fraud detection tooling.

## 3. Data & Storage Layers
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial queries.
- **Sharding Strategy**: Geographic sharding (city/region-based) using Citus or native partitioning.
- **Read Replicas**: For read-heavy services (search, read-only dashboards).
- **Caching**: Redis for session data, hot inventory, matching pre-computations.
- **Object Storage**: S3/GCS buckets for media (reviews, documents, AR assets).
- **Search & Discovery**: Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for full-text search, faceting, geospatial distance ranking.
- **Analytics Warehouse**: BigQuery/Snowflake for aggregated insights and ML training datasets.

## 4. Messaging & Integration
- **Event Bus**: Kafka/RabbitMQ for asynchronous events (order.created, delivery.assigned, review.submitted).
- **Command Queue**: Redis Streams for lightweight real-time tasks (notification fan-out, match recalculations).
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Temporal/Camunda for complex flows (try-before-buy logistics, dispute resolution).
- **Realtime Channels**: WebSockets via managed service (Pusher) or self-hosted (Socket.IO with Redis adapter).

## 5. Deployment & DevOps
- **Containerization**: Docker images per microservice.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with autoscaling (HPA) based on CPU/memory/message backlog.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipelines with automated tests, security scans, canary deploys.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/Helm charts for repeatable environments.
- **Environments**: Dev → Staging → Production; feature flags for progressive rollout.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards, Sentry for error tracking, OpenTelemetry traces.
- **Logging**: Centralized logs via ELK/EFK stack with retention policies.

## 6. Security & Compliance Architecture
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager/GCP Secret Manager.
- **Network Security**: API gateway rate limiting, WAF, mutual TLS between services, VPC segmentation.
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest (KMS), TLS 1.2+, PII minimization.
- **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA, data localization (e.g., India for relevant data), audit trails, access reviews.
- **Fraud Detection**: Anomaly detection pipeline, risk scoring service, manual review tools.

## 7. Sustainability & Performance Hooks
- Track delivery mode (foot, bike, EV) and compute emission savings.
- Optimize routing for low-emission choices; integrate into matching and incentives.
- Cache geospatial computations; use approximate nearest neighbor (H3/S2) indexing for fast proximity queries.

## 8. Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling of stateless services behind load balancers.
- Geo-replication for multi-region deployment; traffic routing via global load balancer.
- Database partitioning by city; cold data archived to cheaper storage.
- Performance testing using Locust/K6; automated load regression in CI.
- Graceful degradation strategies: reduce recommendation load, fallback to cached results under stress.

## 9. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity
- **Backups**: Automated daily snapshots, PITR for PostgreSQL, cross-region replication.
- **Failover**: Warm standby clusters; DNS-based failover or multi-region active-active.
- **Incident Response**: Runbooks per service, on-call rotations, simulated game days.

## 10. Future Extensions
- AI-powered dynamic ETA predictions (serverless functions triggered via queue events).
- Community forums service, social sharing integrations.
- Smart home voice assistant connectors (Alexa, Google Assistant) via dedicated integration service.
