# NEARX Non-Functional Requirements & Implementation Roadmap

## 1. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### 1.1 Availability & Reliability
- Target uptime of **99.9%**; SLOs defined per service.
- Graceful degradation with cached recommendations when matching engine is degraded.
- Automated health checks (liveness/readiness probes) and blue-green/canary deployments.
- Retry policies with idempotency keys for order/payment operations.

### 1.2 Performance
- Mobile app cold start <3s on mid-range devices; subsequent interactions <100ms.
- API latency: P50 <150ms, P95 <300ms for reads; P95 <500ms for writes.
- Real-time updates for delivery/service tracking within 2s of event occurrence.
- Database queries optimized with indexes, prepared statements, and caching.

### 1.3 Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of stateless services via Kubernetes HPA.
- Geo-sharded database architecture with capacity planning for 1M MAUs.
- Event-driven architecture for asynchronous workloads (notifications, analytics).
- Ability to spin up new city-region clusters with infrastructure-as-code scripts.

### 1.4 Security & Privacy
- OWASP Top 10 compliance, regular penetration testing.
- End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.2+), encryption at rest via KMS.
- RBAC for internal tools; audit logs for sensitive actions.
- GDPR/CCPA compliance, regional data localization (e.g., India data stored within jurisdiction).
- 2FA for admins and optional for users; privacy controls for address sharing.

### 1.5 Observability
- Centralized logging with structured logs and correlation IDs.
- Metrics (Prometheus) covering latency, error rates, resource usage, eco-delivery adoption.
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) across microservices.
- Alerting with on-call rotation, escalation policies, and runbooks.

### 1.6 Accessibility & Internationalization
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for mobile and web interfaces.
- Support for multiple languages (English, Nepali, Hindi), with localization pipeline.
- RTL readiness and dynamic font scaling support up to 200%.

### 1.7 Sustainability
- Track carbon footprint per delivery/trial; display eco badges.
- Incentivize eco-friendly options through UI prominence and rewards.
- Optimize routing for low emission vehicles; integrate sustainability metrics into reports.

### 1.8 Compliance & Legal
- Maintain updated ToS, Privacy Policy, data processing agreements.
- Insurance integration compliance, age-restricted product handling.
- Audit trails for approvals, payouts, and dispute resolutions.

### 1.9 Testing & Quality Assurance
- Automated unit (>80% coverage), integration, and end-to-end tests in CI.
- Performance regression tests before major releases.
- Chaos engineering experiments quarterly to validate resilience.
- Beta testing program with user feedback loops.

## 2. Implementation Roadmap (12-Month Horizon)

### Phase 0: Discovery & Foundations (Month 0-1)
- Finalize requirements, UX prototypes, branding.
- Set up project repositories, CI/CD pipelines, coding standards.
- Provision initial cloud infrastructure (dev/staging) with Terraform.

### Phase 1: Core Platform MVP (Months 1-3)
- Implement identity service, user profiles, preferences.
- Build search/discovery with geospatial filtering; integrate PostGIS.
- Develop cart/checkout, product orders, payment integration (Stripe, local wallets).
- Launch customer app MVP (Home, Products, Cart, Orders, Profile) and basic merchant portal.
- Set up basic delivery coordination via manual assignment.

### Phase 2: Services & Booking Expansion (Months 3-5)
- Extend provider onboarding, certification workflows.
- Implement service booking flows with availability calendars and emergency flag.
- Introduce try-before-buy scheduling (in-store) with deposit handling.
- Launch admin console for approvals and support ticketing.

### Phase 3: Delivery Ecosystem (Months 4-6)
- Build delivery partner app with job queue, navigation, SOS.
- Automate delivery assignment, routing, rerouting logic.
- Integrate insurance information and emergency response workflows.
- Add live tracking to customer app; real-time WebSocket updates.

### Phase 4: Try-Before-Buy Home Trials & AR (Months 5-7)
- Enable home trial logistics coordination with delivery partners.
- Integrate AR try-on SDK for supported categories/devices.
- Implement return condition tracking and automated deposit adjustments.

### Phase 5: Analytics, Promotions & Personalization (Months 6-8)
- Merchant analytics dashboards with trends, eco-impact metrics.
- Promotion builder and campaign management tools.
- ML personalization MVP for recommendations and matching weight tuning.
- Review moderation tooling and sentiment analysis.

### Phase 6: Optimization & Scale (Months 7-12)
- Launch loyalty program, referral features, community content.
- Enhance fraud detection models, anomaly alerts.
- Introduce voice assistant integrations and smart home triggers.
- Conduct multi-region deployment readiness; scale infrastructure.
- Achieve WCAG AA compliance, accessibility audits, and load testing.

### Ongoing Streams
- **SRE & DevOps**: Monitoring, cost optimization, incident response.
- **Security & Compliance**: Audits, policy updates, training.
- **Customer Success**: Usability research, feedback incorporation.
- **Sustainability Initiatives**: Track KPIs, partner programs for eco deliveries.

## 3. Milestones & KPIs
- **M3**: MVP launch in pilot city; 500 pilot users; order completion <40 min median.
- **M6**: Services and delivery ecosystem live; 5k MAUs; eco delivery adoption 30%.
- **M9**: Try-before-buy home trials + AR; loyalty program beta; NPS >50.
- **M12**: Multi-city rollout readiness; 50k MAUs; eco deliveries 40%; uptime 99.9%.
